# Reason for archiving
As mod loaders update new breaking changes happen and random bugs, some refactors have been made here and there to make updating easier, with the recent large-scale breaking changes, I've decided to just start a few things over (this also removes the numerous filler commits that I've made to trigger reruns). While the underlying logic will be pretty much the same thing, there will be some changes and hence deviate from the below-listed goals (this has already happened for the 1.20 branches). The new fork can be found at https://github.com/AshOnDiscord/CDACrystalOptimizer

# CrystalOptimizer
Fork of CDAGaming's Optimizer which is based of Marlow's.
No major changes will be made here other than porting, any changes upstreamed will be merged ASAP.
This is purely due to the expiration of Action artifacts.

## Why not just upload the built files via releases?
It requuires trust that I won't modify any of the files. Actions is fully transparent as you can see not only the code being ran but also what actions is doing with the code to prevent actions modifing any files causing modified action files.

## How to download the actions files?
If you have an account just head to the actions tab and open the run for the version you want and download the artifacts.
If you don't have an account, use the nightly links from [this gist post](https://gist.github.com/AshOnDiscord/d8c680e695b532464d26ecb3bd0cf943), copy the link for your version, head to it and it'll download the artifacts.  
Once you have the artifacts just extract it and use the jar.

Last Artifact Build: 4/26/24
